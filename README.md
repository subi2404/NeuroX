   Predict and visualize multiple cognitive health outcomes based on different treatment paths and lifestyle choices. This feature helps users evaluate potential futures and make informed decisions about their health.

2. **Cognitive Twin AI**  
   Track brain evolution over time through a personalized digital twin, which simulates and models the user’s unique neural patterns, offering a tailored view of cognitive progress.

3. **Virtual Treatment Simulator**  
   Optimize therapeutic strategies by simulating the expected outcomes of various treatments before their application, using AI-driven predictions to ensure more effective health management.

4. **MindVault AI**  
   Securely preserve and retrieve personal memories through neural pattern storage technology, allowing users to track significant cognitive milestones over time.

5. **Multi-User Login**  
   NeuroX supports multiple user roles—patients, doctors, and caregivers—each with distinct access permissions and capabilities for collaboration, monitoring, and treatment management.

6. **Real-Time Progress Tracking**  
   Track cognitive health progress with AI-generated reports and visualizations, helping users and healthcare providers monitor treatment efficacy and adjust strategies as needed.

7. **Interactive Cognitive Dashboard**  
   Engage with a variety of brain training exercises, memory games, and AI-generated tasks that promote cognitive enhancement in a user-friendly, gamified format.

8. **Secure Communication Portal**  
   Real-time communication tools for patients, doctors, and caregivers to facilitate collaboration and provide a seamless experience for monitoring health progress.
